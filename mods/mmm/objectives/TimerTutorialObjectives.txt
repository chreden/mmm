Timer Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates timers. The freighters will explode one by one with increasing frequency - the interval is changed in the hook function.

See the Timer Tutorial in the Megadroid's Mission Mod section of Modding on the Fleet Operations guide for more information (http://guide.fleetops.net).
