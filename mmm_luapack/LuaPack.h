/*
	Lua Pack is a native API to the packer that is used by MMM itself 
	and by the packing tool. It packs mission lua files so that they
	can be redistributed more easily ( one file instead of many ).

	A Pack contains the actual script files as well as metadata about
	the creator and the mission information.
